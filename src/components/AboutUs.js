    <p className="mb-4">
      We are a diverse team of ten high-school students from across India. Connecting our passions in space sciences and data-science driven modelling, we created this Exoplanet Habitability Predictor. Collaborating entirely online, we organized ourselves into dedicated sub-teams: a research group, focussed on acquiring authentic and clean data, and making sense out of it; a modelling team that built the ML model; and a front-end team focused on building a clean, functional interface. Our project aims to bridge scientific inquiry and accessible technology.

      The research foundation was laid by <b>Anirudh S.</b> and <b>Arnav Venkatesh</b>. The data classification and cleaning was handled by <b>Ainak Kundu</b>, <b>Ayisha Mehrin</b>, <b>Vidhi Bansal</b>, along with <b>Aryan Lalwani</b>, who derived observational parameters. The core modelling was carried out by <b>Priyanshu Mishra</b>, while integration of the model with the front end was managed by <b>Aryan</b>, <b>Ayisha Mehrin</b>, and <b>Mehak</b>. The interactive front-end interface was designed by <b>Kabir Khan</b> and <b>Mufaddal Mansoor Hasan</b>. Final inputs to the website were contributed by <b>Anirudh</b>, <b>Arnav</b>, and <b>Vidhi</b>.
